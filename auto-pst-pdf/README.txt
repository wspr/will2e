The auto-pst-pdf package
v0.6          2009/04/26

The package uses -shell-escape to execute pst-pdf.
This makes it especially easy to integrate into the
workflow of an editor with just "LaTeX" and "pdfLaTeX"
buttons.

Wrappers are provided for various psfrag-related
features so that Matlab figures via laprint, Mathematica
figures via MathPSfrag, and regular psfrag figures can
all be input consistently and easily.
