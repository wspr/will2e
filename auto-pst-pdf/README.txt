========================
The auto-pst-pdf package

2009/04/26 v0.6

The package uses `-shell-escape` to execute `pst-pdf`.
This makes it especially easy to integrate into the
workflow of an editor with just "LaTeX" and "pdfLaTeX"
buttons.

Wrappers are provided for various psfrag-related
features so that Matlab figures via laprint, Mathematica
figures via MathPSfrag, and regular psfrag figures can
all be input consistently and easily.
